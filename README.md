- 👋 Hi, I’m @pauljnis.
- 👀 I’m interested in a programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning an app for coding the html document of the examination review of web creator examination.
- 💞️ I’m looking for friends so as to collaborate on such a programming JavaScript with html and CSS together with a friend.
      I start studing Git for preparing GitHub as my homepage.
