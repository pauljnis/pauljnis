- 👋 Hi, I’m @pauljnis.
- 👀 I’m interested in not only a video editing but also a programming about an immigrant lawyer examination & answer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning an app for coding the html document of the examination review.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on such a programming JavaScript with html $ CSS together with a friend.
